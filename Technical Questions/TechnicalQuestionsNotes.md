# How to Solve problems

1. **Try to solve the problem on your own** - push yourself to develop a solution with as little help as possible. Many questions will be tough, and that is alright. Be sure to think about space and time efficiency

2. **Write the code on paper** - Coding on a computer offers help such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and quick debugging. Coding on paper does not

3. **Test your code - On Paper** 

4. **Type your paper code as-is into your computer** - This will help you know what mistakes you are regularly making and can improve on.
